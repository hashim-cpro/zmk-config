# üî® ZMK Build Error Fix - RC Macro Conflict

## Issue Resolved: RC Macro Conflict

**Problem**: Build failed due to macro name conflict between:

- ZMK's `RC` macro (Right Control modifier in `dt-bindings/zmk/modifiers.h`)
- Matrix transform `RC(row, col)` usage in overlay file

**Error Message**:

```
error: macro "RC" passed 2 arguments, but takes just 1
```

## ‚úÖ **Fix Applied**

### 1. Removed conflicting include from overlay

**File**: `boards/shields/id1/id1.overlay`

```diff
- #include <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>  // REMOVED - causes RC macro conflict
+ // Keys header moved to keymap file where it belongs
```

### 2. Fixed matrix transform syntax

**File**: `boards/shields/id1/id1.overlay`

```diff
- RC(0,0) RC(0,1) RC(0,2) ...  // OLD - conflicted with RC modifier
+ 0 0  0 1  0 2 ...           // NEW - proper matrix coordinates
```

### 3. Verified keymap includes

**File**: `boards/shields/id1/id1.keymap` (already correct)

```c
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>  // ‚úÖ CORRECT - keys belong in keymap
```

## Build Again

Your ZMK configuration should now build successfully:

```bash
cd /home/hashim/Projects/60_Percent_Keyboard/Firmware/zmk-config
./build.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
west build -p -b seeeduino_xiao_ble -- -DSHIELD=id1
```

## What Was Fixed

| File          | Issue                                         | Fix                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `id1.overlay` | Included `keys.h` causing RC macro conflict   | Removed keys.h include      |
| `id1.overlay` | Used `RC(row,col)` syntax in matrix transform | Changed to `row col` format |
| `id1.keymap`  | Needed keys.h for keycodes                    | Already correct             |

## Expected Result

‚úÖ **Build should now succeed** and produce `build/zephyr/zmk.uf2`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: You may still see warnings about PCF8575 drivers since ZMK doesn't have built-in support, but the build should complete successfully.

## Next Steps After Successful Build

1. **Flash firmware** to test basic functionality
2. **Verify USB/Bluetooth connectivity**
3. **Test any working GPIO pins**
4. **Plan PCF8575 driver development** or consider switching to QMK

The macro conflict is now resolved! üéâ
